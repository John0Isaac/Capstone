# Capstone

This is my final nanodegree project and I'm so excited to finish it i thought of many ideas but none matched what they needed so i said to myself why don't i use all my knowldege to implement this final application. The application can:

1) Display persons in our data base. persons should show all the needed information about them for employers.
2) Display industries for managers to edit them.
3) Delete persons or industries.
4) Add new person and require that they include all the information needed.
5) Add new industry by managers.
6) Search for persons based on a text query string.
